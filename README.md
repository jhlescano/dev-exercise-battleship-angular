# Developer exercise: Battleship

This is my implementation of the Battleship game with Angular as a developer exercise.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

---

## Brief description

This project recreates the board game Battleship on a single player mode.

* Game Setup - Configure a new game
* Game Board - Play the game!
* Match history - Results list of finished games

There are 10 ships of different sizes (preconfigured) placed randomly on the board.
The goal is to hit all the ships cells before running out of turns.
